{"prompt":"If there is a customer telling me that our app is not showing, not working, what should I do?","completion":"The best practice is that you should be testing the feature on your own store first, to know how it is working in the first place. If you have never configured it, you cannot support the customer with it. If it is a storefront app, you should be testing if our app is the only app that is not working, if the store has a critical error that is blocking all the other third party app from running, there is no way that our app can run as well.\nThen you should refer to our internal documentation to check for common case troubleshooting or ask the leader, developer team for further support. But first, always remember to "}
{"prompt":"Does Avada Cookie Bar block tracking, and if so, how does it block it?","completion":"Avada Cookie Bar functions by displaying a visually appealing and responsive banner to gather GDPR consent from customers. After a customer clicks OK (consent) on the banner, the app interacts with the Shopify Customer Privacy API. The process of blocking tracking, cookies, and collecting customer information is managed by Shopify through this API, ensuring GDPR compliance. However, the specific blocking capabilities may depend on whether third-party apps adhere to the Shopify Customer Privacy API."}
{"prompt":"Can Avada Cookie Bar block tracking from third-party apps?","completion":"The ability to block tracking from third-party apps depends on whether these apps adhere to the Shopify Customer Privacy API and only conduct tracking with customer consent. AVADA Cookie Bar follows Shopify's standards and can block tracking if third-party apps comply with Shopify's standards. However, if these apps do not adhere to the standards, AVADA Cookie Bar may not be able to block tracking from them."}
{"prompt":"What makes the Avada Cookie Bar display in the storefront, technically?","completion":"First you need to make sure that the app is enabled in the Theme Editor of Shopify. It should be checking for if there is two things first: \n\nAVADA_COOKIES_BAR variable in the F12 console tool, this variable save all the data of the setting for the cookie bar display, from which the Javascript file can take the setting and display the banner accordingly.\n\nYou need to check if the Javascript file avada-cookie.js is available in the network tab or `Ctrl +P` to search for the file. If these meets, the bar should be visiable."}
{"prompt":"I checked for the Javascript file, but the file is not loaded in the store? Avada Cookie bar banner is not showing on my site","completion":"You should be checking if the avada-cookie.js is available in the store source code in the `Ctrl+U` inspect. If the code is no where to be found, it can be that the Shopify Scripttag of our app is not yet registered, or the app embed block in the theme editor is not yet enabled.\n\nIf the JS file is found on the page source, but you cannot find any sight of it running, you might be checking for any critical console error on the Console tab of your browser, if there is any, it will block the rendering of the whole page Javascript, including many other features, apps, which our app is one of them. So you check if the theme.liquid in the Shopify admin, and check if there is any syntax, HTML error in them, if there is, you should be fixing theme first. This trouble-shooting approach should be applied for any frontend displaying apps."}
{"prompt":"Why I went for the AVADA_COOKIES_BAR, I checked them on the theme source, but it is no where to be found?","completion":"This AVADA_COOKIES_BAR window variable is critical for the displaying of the Avada Cookie bar. If somehow you cannot see it, there is may be something go wrong during the installation of the app, you can try hitting the Republish button within the app, and it will reinvoke all the after-install procedure of the app, save all the meta field, asset file on the Shopify theme liquid code if it is had to. \nFor the vintage theme, you should check if the theme.liquid has our liquid snippet file. Previously, before the 2023-04 API version, Shopify still allows us to make changes to the Theme files using API. However, after the end of 2023, all apps have to use OS 2.0 approach instead and update to 2023-04 API version. Now our app can no longer add snippet to theme.liquid file. So if customer is using OS 2 theme, and still not see their App Embed button to enable inside the Shopify Theme Editor, you can go to our Dev Zone, re-configure this customer to be valid by clicking “Fix embed app not shown” button. \n\nIf the customer has installed our app previously and used the adding snippet approach, which is no longer available since 2024, we need to convert them OS 2 approach just like above as well."}
{"prompt":"I cannot see the app Avada Cookie Bar in the Theme Editor to enable it?","completion":"If customer is using OS 2 theme, and still not see their App Embed button to enable inside the Shopify Theme Editor, you can go to our Dev Zone, re-configure this customer to be valid by clicking “Fix embed app not shown” button. \n"}
{"prompt":"All the variable and the JS file are found, but I cannot see the Avada Cookie bar banner?","completion":"It can be of the configuration, you should try changing the setting to All countries to test if the bar is displaying or not, if it is, you should be checking for if you are in a non-GDPR zones. You can test it by switching IP using a VPN, if they do appear, it is just a problems with configuration."}
{"prompt":"I have configured the Avada Cookie Bar, clicked the Deny button, or not yet consent-given, but my data is still collected?","completion":"There could be a few reasons for that:\nYou have not congifure the Data Privacy preference in the Shopify admin to “Collect after consent”. If you do, the Shopify Customer Privacy API which our app relies on will work correctly. If you do not, you may be not setting our the app right. You can check using Javascript, by checking for this variable value: Shopify.customerPrivacy.getShopPrefs(), if they contains GDPR, then it should be working properly.\n\nSecondly, our apps does not block all thirds party apps if they do not follow Shopify Customer Privacy API. So if it is a third-party app tracking, we cannot block them yet."}
{"prompt":"Can I have many Cookie bar banner app running together, or having Avada Cookie bar with another cookie banner app?","completion":"It is a no. You should be using on Cookie Bar banner app at a time. Since many cookie apps leverage the Shopify Customer Privacy API, each app might be writing their own value to the Shopify API. So if there are many apps, we cannot make sure that the final value will be correctly stored.\nAlso, apps like Pandates GDPR cookie banner, they wrongly override the Shopify Customer Privacy API, which can makes all other apps using Shopify Customer Privacy API behave wrongly. You should be aware. "}
{"prompt":"The cookie bar is displayed, but it does not behave correctly since it is not showing to GDPR countries, or the tracking still persist before consent. Weirdly, everything for the app to work is correct, it is not functioning properly to Shopify Customer Privacy API?","completion":"It can be the you are using more than 1 cookie bar banner app, which also use Shopify Customer Privacy API. Many app can override or race condition with Shopify API, especially Pandates. You should be checking if you are using many GDPR apps at a time. You should be testing our app indepently to know if there actually working."}
{"prompt":"Our app is displaying incorrectly to the design, setting behavior from the admin? The link on the cookie, the style is like taken from another user setting? We have updated the setting but no way it is reflected?","completion":"It may be because of the store installed the app long ago, it still have the avada-cookie-bar snippet included in the theme.liquid file, but the Avada Cookie bar Embed App block in the theme editor section. So basically there is duplicated initalization of the AVADA_COOKIE_BARS variable which is why the setting cannot be updated, since the data is taken from the wrong source. You should remove the snippet code from the theme.liquid and only use the data from OS 2.0 block.\nSecondly, it can be that the site is using some sort of cache, which make them unable to update anything on the store, not just our app setting. The way to testify this is that you make changes to the theme, or store design, if the design is not reflected then it is a problem with the site, not with our app.\n\nThe second reason can be common in any other app support queries as well. You should bear this approach in mind if encounter any similar question."}
{"prompt":"When clicking the Agree, or deny button, there is an error bad request to set_tracking_consent.json on the console, this is a request to Shopify Customer Privacy API?","completion":"This seems to be a problem with Shopify. You can change the Customer Privacy in the admin between Collected before consent or Collected after consent and save the setting, and then save it back to the original value again to purge Shopify saved data. It should be working after that. "}
{"prompt":"The email campaign or automation in the Avada Email Marketing app is not sent successfully with the message: “Exceeded daily email sending limit”?","completion":"Our free plan has the limit of 12k email per month and 400 emails per day. If you are sending a campaign with more than 400 contacts at a time, or exceed your daily, monthly limit, you should be seeing this."}
{"prompt":"In Avada Email marketing, we cannot send a test email message inside the email editor, or campaign, automation email with the error message of of format “Expected } (line x, char y)”?","completion":"It can be that the email content or subject, preheader, is using an invalid liquid variable. It should in format like {{shop_name}}, {{shop_website}}. Sometimes, customer misunderstand, and replace the variable like {{shop_website}} with value like: {{https://example.com}}, which made an invalid liquid variable since there is no variable named https://example.com. Or sometimes, they just wrongly write it like: {{ customer_name} (missing a bracket) or using space instead of _ like: {{ customer name}}. The case can be various, but you should be checking for wrongly formated liquid variable. \n\nAnother reason is that they are using a invalid external font files, please refer to this link: https://kb.avada.net/docs/khong-gui-djuoc-send-test-email-khi-dung-custom-font"}
{"prompt":"In Avada Email Marketing, can our Avada Abandoned Cart workflow work if the customer leave the email on another app popup form? Can we use that email for identifying the customer identify and track their cart, if they do not make it to the checkout step (which Shopify normally stores it as abandoned carts in their admin)?","completion":"We have two abandoned flow: Abandoned checkout and Abandoned cart. The abandoned checkout use the Shopify checkout create, update webhook to sync the abandoned checkout from Shopify.\n\nBesides, we  have the Abandoned cart to track the abandoned carts which are not yet reached the checkout step, but somehow their ID, normally email is left on our popup form like Newsletter form, or Add-to-cart popup form.

{"prompt":"In Avada Email Marketing, we have feature for the customer to register their email for sending email using our sending domain. We need to send a verification to their email address but customer cannot see the email in their inbox, why?","completion":"First, the email may end up in spam box. However, normally, our verification email is a transactional email with good sending reputation, it will normally reach the inbox.\nSecondly, the email that customer use does not really have an inbox. We can check in our Mailgun admin, search for the target email, sent from the domain send.avada.io to see if the email is bounced because of the invalid email address. If after that, they have setup an email, we can go to Mailgun, remove the bounced address from the Supression list so that they can receive that email."}
{"prompt":"Should I use gmail, outlook, hotmail, personal email as a sender for Avada?","completion":"You should not use personal email for sending email as marketing email using 3rd party apps. They will get bounced all the time if you do. You should use business email instead.\r"}
{"prompt":"In Avada Email Marketing, why I created a automation flow called Ask for review and I cannot trigger email event for this workflow?","completion":"The triggering event for the Ask for review originally in our app is using the Place order event. It is used for the merchant to setup follow up email on customer purchase for a review of their purchased products. However, if customer wants to configured the email to trigger after the order is fulfilled or paid, it is currently not possible with this since it is using Place Order trigger. \n\nWe should use another custom workflow, choose the trigger to be New Shipment which can cover the use case of trigger workflow after order paid. It should be a debt of our app, we should have an improvement but currently this is the best workaround."}
{"prompt":"During the verification of domain to be added to Avada Email Marketing for sending emails, the customer add the CNAME record to the DNS and got error: “CNAME record with the same name already exists”, why?","completion":"It is what said in the error: “CNAME record with the same name already exists”. Normally, we recommend the customer to add CNAME record with value of “sending”. However, if customer is using many apps, they may already register a CNAME with that value. It is kinda simple to solve, we can just change the name for the CNAME to sendingavada, or sendingavada, or sendavada, any namespace that is not taken yet on the DNS. "}
{"prompt":"The coupon in the Avada Email Marketing Form popup, which is given after the customer sign up the newsletter or spin the SpinToWin popup, is not usable on the Shopify store?","completion":"Our Avada Popup Form is used to collect customer emails, phone. Optionally, the Thank you step of the popup will have a coupon for the customer to use for the store.\n\nOur popup is just giving out coupon codes which are set up in the app. It can be static coupon code, or dynamic coupons. You should check the discount in the Shopify admin whether the discount is created in the Shopify admin or not. You should also check for discount condition if it has time, customer, product, collection limit for this discount. One mistake most of the time customer make is that the customer use the default code WELCOME10 in the form, but did not create it in the Shopify admin."}
{"prompt":"Why cannot I send the test email in the campaign or automation? I got the error message: “Unauthorized”?","completion":"In the devzone, you should check the Account Settings in the Devzone, see the Mailgun Sending Domain configuration and check if the the sending domain assigned to the account is valid. Normally, you may mistype this domain, please check this guide for reference: https://kb.avada.net/docs/manage-email-reputation#sending-domain"}
{"prompt":"When adding a domain to Avada Email marketing, we got Forbidden error?","completion":"It is because of our Mailgun domain is blocked from creating a domain. Please contact BA who is responsible for this app so that they can create a ticket to Mailgun to open creating domain for our account. The reason why our account is blocked is because one of our domain is sending unsophisticated emails which caused high bounced rate. Our system is normally attacked by spammers who want to use our system to send spam emails. It is quite a common issue while maintaining Avada Email Marketing app."}
{"prompt":"Why our send test email is not reached my Outlook, hotmail inbox but Gmail.com is ok?","completion":"For ISPs, mostly they take the domain reputation into account when judging if an email is a legit email with good sending hygiene or not. With Outlook and Hotmail, they take IPs into account when it comes to reputation of the sender. Please refer this guide as how to change the IP for the email here: https://kb.avada.net/docs/manage-email-reputation"}
{"prompt":"Why the email got a big red banner warning phishing email?","completion":"Normally, it would not happen since some of our user may send spam emails, but they normally would not send fraud, unsophisticated emails content. If there are some of their people leverage our system to send scam emails, our tracking link, which would replace the original link in the email like: `https://avada.io` to `https://trk1.avdlink.com/click/abce...` in order to collect the click action of an user on the email for analytics purpose.\n\nSince our domain is used in the email, and the phishing or scam email comes with a link to another fake website where they stole user information. So if our link appears in a scam-flagged email, it is a blacklist sentence and no way away from there. The only way is to register a new domain and replace the tracking domain that customer is using to a new one, and change for our whole system as well.\n\nPlease see this guide to know how to change a customer tracking link domain: https://kb.avada.net/docs/manage-email-reputation"}

Normally, it show the customer name, if no name, the default value would be “Guest”. There is no way to translate this?","completion":"You do not need to translate this value “Guest”. Just change the default value of the {{customer_name}} to another value, which is the language of the email content instead. The format you can use is: {{ customer_name | default: \"Something here\" }}, which is a liquid syntax."}
{"prompt":"Why the email content which is actually sent is different from the email which is in the email editor inside Avada Email Marketing?","completion":"Reason:\n\nThe customer has not published the email; it is still saved as a draft. Therefore, when sending, the content will not be received. It's important to instruct the customer to publish the edited version or publish it for them.\n\nHow to check:\nIf the publish button in the editor is not dimmed and still active, it means the customer has not published the email content.\n\nAnother way to check is to compare the workflow preview with the editor. If the preview differs, it indicates that it has not been published. The sent email will resemble the preview in the workflow.\n\nYou can see this guide for reference: https://kb.avada.net/docs/email-djuoc-gui-khac-voi-email-trong-editor"}
